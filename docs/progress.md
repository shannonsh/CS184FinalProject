# Progress Report

## Finished tasks
So far we have implemented two styles of shading: Blinn Phong (has multiple layers of shadow and a highlight layer), and diffuse shading (multiple layers of shadow and no highlight). We have accomplished n level shading, as in n different layers of shadows can be added to the model, but this has to be done programatically, and the user cannot decide the levels of shadow themselves.
